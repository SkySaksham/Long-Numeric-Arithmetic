# Long-Numeric-Arithemetic

A work-in-progress C++ library for doing arithmetic on numbers larger than built-in data types, with exact decimal precision.  
Stores digits in vectors with base 10^9 or 10^18 (chosen automatically depending on compiler and CPU).

## Folders

- **Long-Numeric-Arithemetic** – Current work-in-progress version of the library.
- **Legacy-Code** – Earlier versions with basic arithmetic and experiments on base 10, base 1024, and base 10^6.
- **Benchmarks** – Benchmarking results and comparisons with other libraries.

## Features (in progress)

- Arbitrary length integers and decimals
- Exact decimal precision
- Basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Vector-based storage with large base
- Benchmark scripts

## Planned Features

- Simpler and more user-friendly API
- Karatsuba multiplication for faster performance
- Division with exact decimal precision
- More features and goals will be added as progress is made

## Status

Still under development. Expect frequent updates and changes.
