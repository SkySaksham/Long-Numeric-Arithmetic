#  Long Numeric Arithmetic Library

A C++ library for handling **very large numbers**, supporting basic arithmetic and factorial calculations.
Currently supports integers, signs, and string conversion, with room for future expansion.

---

##  Features

* Representation of large numbers:

  * Sign (positive / negative)
  * Length tracking
  * Optional decimals (storage ready, operations not implemented yet)
* Arithmetic support:

  * Addition of two numbers with the same sign (integers only)
* Factorial calculation
* Utility functions:

  * `numb_print()` â€“ Print the number
  * `numb_to_str()` â€“ Convert number to string

---

##  Example Usage

```cpp
#include "Number.h"
#include "NumberUtils.h"
#include "operations/addition.h"
#include "special_ops/factorialbase9.h"

int main() {
    Number num;
    str_to_numb("12345678901234567890", num);
    numb_print(num); // prints the number

    Number fact = factorial(10000);
    numb_print(fact);

    return 0;
}
```
